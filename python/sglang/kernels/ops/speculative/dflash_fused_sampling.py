"""Fused ROCm verifier for DFLASH non-greedy (temperature > 0) speculative decoding.

The stock ROCm path costs far more than the greedy path even though it does
almost no extra arithmetic. Measured on Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8 (vocab 248320,
draft_len 8, top_k 20, top_p 0.95), per decode step:

    greedy  t=0    621 CPU ops,  5.12 ms CPU,  GPU idle  8.5%
    sampling t=0.7 965 CPU ops, 38.61 ms CPU,  GPU idle 24.1%

The op *count* only grows 1.55x while the op *time* grows 7.5x, because three
of the added ops block on the device. The extra GPU compute is under 0.2 ms.

Two things cause that gap, and this module removes both.

1.  Density. `build_dflash_verify_target_probs` takes the sparse top-k result
    -- k=20 values per row -- and scatters it into a dense (bs*draft_len,
    vocab) tensor, then `chain_speculative_sampling_target_only` allocates a
    second dense tensor of the same size for `draft_probs`. That is two 7.9 MB
    zero-fills plus a scatter per step to carry 160 useful numbers, and it
    forces the residual sampler to scan 248320 entries per row with a single
    workgroup.

2.  Host stalls. The chain verifier is ~30 separate torch ops, three of which
    (`predicts[mask] = ...`, `if bool(has_rejection.any())`, `.nonzero()`)
    require the mask on the host and therefore drain the stream. That collapses
    overlap scheduling and leaves the GPU idle until the CPU catches up.

The observation that makes fusing easy: the caller only ever consumes two
values, `accept_len` and `bonus`. Everything else -- `predicts`, `accept_index`,
`draft_probs` -- is scaffolding the CUDA operator's signature demands. And the
accept test needs a *single* probability per level (that of the proposed token),
not a distribution. So the verify runs on the k-sized top-k output and never
materialises anything vocab-shaped.

Probabilities are produced by the *same torch calls the stock path makes*,
applied to the k-sized top-k result rather than to a dense vocab-sized tensor:
the same temperature division, the same `torch.topk`, the same rank mask, the
same `F.softmax`, the same `top_p_renorm_prob`. They are therefore bit-identical
to stock by construction rather than by a rounding argument. Two earlier
versions of this file re-derived those steps and diverged from stock by one
float32 ULP in two different places -- once by selecting the top-k on unscaled
logits, once by hand-rolling the softmax -- and in both cases a single ULP was
enough to flip `coin <= tps` and change the emitted token. Anything that decides
an acceptance must be computed the way stock computes it.

What the Triton kernel does, and all it does, is the part that has no torch
equivalent without host syncs: the chain accept walk and the residual draw.
